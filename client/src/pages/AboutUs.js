        <p>
        FightPandemics is the brainchild of Manuel Gonzalez Alzuru, who was infected with COVID-19 in France. 
        Upon returning home to Barcelona, he found he was unable to get help even though there were people who wanted to provide it. 
        Telegram and WhatsApp groups were self-organizing in Manuelâ€™s neighborhood, but without personally knowing anyone involved he 
        ould not ask them for assistance. Inspired by so many coming together, Manuel launched the project with one mission in mind: to 
        ensure that others could connect in time.
