      "Does anyone have an extra pack of disinfecting Clorax wipes? I would be very grateful if you could sell me one. Two people in our family have chronic pulmonary diseases, including my son. We are isolated, but my husband might infect us, as he works with people a lot. We need to constantly disinfect all the surfaces. We've been searching for over a week, but they seem to be gone everywhere. Maybe someone has a stockpile or seen them in stores?",
